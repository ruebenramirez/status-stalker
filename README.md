status-stalker
==============
##Quick status updates:
* provide a tool for a team member to build a list of the things they’re working on and get a ping for a status update
* allow managers to ask for a status update
* if someone updates their status, allow to push to various chat channels.  (highlight + link for more info)
* a bump to a team member if they have assigned work with no update for a defined threshold of days
* MVP - web application
* future - would be nice to have a google + hangouts type desktop app (something that doesn’t require a lot of real-estate)
    * how difficult would it be to build a quick mozilla/chrome browser plugin?
* TODO: integrate with emails, txt messages, google hangouts, hipchat, irc, expose as API

##What is a status update composed of:
* task label/title
* link to project management task (e.g. JIRA item)
* status update (or just a checkbox for no update)
* poll reminder

###Use Cases:
* sprint planning - members create their tasks for a sprint
* system pings team member for a status update if they've not already updated
* system sends all status updates out to team (via preferred communication method)
* if team member lists a blocker, we can send notification alerts to the team asking for feedback.
