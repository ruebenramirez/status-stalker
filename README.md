status-stalker
==============
##Quick status updates:
* provide a tool for a team member to build a list of the things they’re working on and get a ping for a status update
* allow managers to ask for a status update
* if someone updates their status, allow to push to various chat channels.  (highlight + link for more info)
* a bump to a team member if they have assigned work with no update for a defined threshold of days
* MVP - web application
* future - would be nice to have a google + hangouts type desktop app (something that doesn’t require a lot of real-estate)
    * how difficult would it be to build a quick mozilla/chrome browser plugin?

##What is a status update built on:
* task label/title
* link to project management task (e.g. JIRA item)
* status update (or just a checkbox for no update)
* poll reminder
